# AccidentsSeverityClassifier
This model was developed to evaluate the importance of features that are related to the severity of aeronautical accidents. For this project, it was used CENIPA's data (available at &lt;https://dados.gov.br/dataset/ocorrencias-aeronauticas-da-aviacao-civil-brasileira>) of occurrences of the Brazilian civil aviation between 2010 and 2019. This Data Science project was developed with the collaboration of Daniel B. Sesso, Fabio T. Alves, and Giovanni P. M. Pinto.
