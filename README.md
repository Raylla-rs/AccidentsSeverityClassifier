# AccidentsSeverityClassifier
This model was developed to evaluate the importance of features that are related to the severity of aeronautical accidents based on the Extra Trees Classifier. For this project, it was used CENIPA's integrated data (available at: <http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4298886>) of occurrences of the Brazilian civil aviation between 2010 and 2019. This Data Science project was developed by Daniel B. Sesso, Fabio T. Alves, Giovanni P. M. Pinto, and Raylla S. Silva.
